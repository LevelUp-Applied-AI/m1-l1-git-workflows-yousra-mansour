All changes must pass `python test_environment.py` before committing.

## Secrets Policy

Do not include API keys, database passwords, file paths containing

Do not modify `requirements.txt` without human review.
Do not modify `setup.sh` without running and testing the result locally.
Do not touch `.gitignore` without confirming the change doesn't
